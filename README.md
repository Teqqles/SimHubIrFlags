# SimHubIrFlags

Custom serial device for pushing flag colours to inexpensive IR controlled RGB light strips

Special thanks to the following, without which this project would have been a lot more complicated:

[https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson) - Arduino library for Json processing so we can have well formatted input.
[https://github.com/Arduino-IRremote/Arduino-IRremote](https://github.com/Arduino-IRremote/Arduino-IRremote) - Arduino library for sending and receiving IR instructions.
